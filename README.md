#Customer-Resource-Management(CRM)

This is a simple app tried by me using spring boot, spring mvc ,jsp and spring rest services. This web app uses the best technology of html, css and bootstrap as the frontend and spring , hibernate and MYSQL 5 as the backend.

You can use any database and you can configure the authentication by editing the application.properties file present under resource directory. 

#IDE USED
